<h1 align="center">Battleship Game!</h1>

Battleship is a two-player game where each player has a game board and attempts to sink their opponent's ships by correctly guessing the location of their opponent's fleet. In your version of the game, the user will play against the computer.

Each player's board is divided into a grid of cells, and each player's fleet is composed of several ships, which are placed on their respective boards. In your game, there are four ships on each board.

Players take turns firing shots at their opponent's board by guessing the coordinates of a cell on the grid. If the guess hits one of the opponent's ships, the player marks the hit on the board. If the guess misses, the player marks the miss on the board.

The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

In your version of the game, the computer will be making randomized guesses against the user's board, while the user tries to sink the computer's fleet.
